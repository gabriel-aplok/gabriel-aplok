## Hello üëã

So, you wanted to take a look at my profile. Welcome!

## Who am I üò≥

My name is Gabriel (_*awesome, right?*_) and I'm an hobbyist developer, or just someone who likes to tinker with technology.

My main language is Brazilian Portuguese, but on the internet I often use English.

## What do I do üî≠

I really like [Android](https://android.com), that's why I work on projects that run on it/with it often.

I always wanted to create my own app or game, with a unique idea, or at least a unique design.

The problem is, I don't have many ideas. üòî
That's why I'm just trying out some cool libraries or reading [docs](https://developer.android.com).

I am currently working at [Kolpa Engine](https://github.com/KolpaEngine).
